# Days since

This is a web app based on <https://github.com/sveltejs/template>.

The app is published right here [tolu.github.io/days-since/](https://tolu.github.io/days-since/)

It simply keeps track on important dates for you to let you know how long it's been since something.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running.

## Credits

The idea for this app comes from the Android app [How Many Days](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bigapps.saydim&hl=en_US)
